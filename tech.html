                <h2>Specialty: iOS and Mac</h2>
                <p>
                    My specialty is iOS (iPhone, iPad), Mac and its frameworks. As a programmer, I have worked with iOS and Mac development for 9 years now. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I am fluent in Swift and Objective-C languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have published apps on the App Store and Enterprise stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Architecturally I have implemented all common design patterns (MVVM, Coordinator, Customized VIPER, etc), have tinkered, and also added to real projects some of the trendy technologies (rxSwift for example). Have been setting up DevOps parts for CI/CD, Fastlane, Bamboo, and others.
                </p>

                <h2>Mobile future is Flutter</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://flutter.dev">Flutter</a>
                    is Google developed cross-platform mobile, 
                                                            web, and desktop framework. Together with Emergn team, I have done Flutter evaluation and research. We found it very feasible to use. I believe in cross-platform approach for most of the enterprise app cases, the near future will show if this is the case.
