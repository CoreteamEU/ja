                        If you survive this industry, that inevitably means, that you should have learnt something.
                                                                                                                                                                        I could state, that I care for good solutions, clients businesses, added value e.t.c,
                                                                                                but it is much more complicated than that. What I really care is good experience and flow for everybody. Is it a programmer, a stakeholder, a product owner,
                                                                                                I tend to ensure that everybody is in the flow towards the goal.
