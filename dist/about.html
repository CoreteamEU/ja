                        My name is Juris Andersons. I am an IT professional with more than
                                                            20 years of experience. I create products. Occasionally play guitar,
                                                            produce, record live music and videos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Surviving IT industry this long, inevitably means, that you should
                                                            have learned something. Sure, I could state, that I care for good
                                                            solutions, client's businesses, added value, etc, in reality, it is
                                                            much more complicated than that.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What I care about is good experience and flow for everybody.
                                                            Usually, it is described as a journey. Whatever we do, it is always
                                                            a trip. No matter is it a programmer, a product stakeholder, a
                                                            product owner, I tend to ensure that everybody is in the flow
                                                            towards the goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>... and then there are deadlines.</p>

                        The time spent in IT has allowed me to become both: "a jack of all
                                                            trades" and a specialist in mobile development. In that sense: I am

                        I have led teams, taught juniors, made decisions on architecture,
                                                            done research, and done actual programming as well. I have met with
                                                            stakeholders to do the analysis of their business and requirements,
                                                            pain points and helped them to achieve their goals by applying my

                        I worked for 11 years in this great company, mostly on leading ERP
                                                            system in Latvia. The ERP system is called
